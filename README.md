## Description
Our nerd club developed its own app to vote for our next president! This app can add people by first name and last name, and track them as individuals with unique ID numbers. You can follow CRUD operations to Create, Read, Update, and Delete all your participants.

## Installation
Clone this repo's code to your computer and pop open the file named 'index.js'. In your terminal, type 'node index' and follow the command prompts. The prompts will continue to cycle through until you hit "Ctrl+C" to quit the terminal session.

## Usage
This is the best way for your worksite to stay organized!
